/*
Strings are compared using == in the filter, so johnFromNy will be returned, but johnFromChicago wonâ€™t be returned, because the instance of name was created with the new String() constructor instead of interning the String. Hence, the instance of String john in the Object johnFromChicago will be different when compared to the instance of String john used in the filter step.
